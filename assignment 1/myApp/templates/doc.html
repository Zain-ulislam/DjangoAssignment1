    <h1>Doc On Django</h1>
    <p>Django is a popular and robust web framework written in Python. It provides a wide range of features and tools that facilitate the development of web applications. Here are some key points about Django

    </p>
    <div>
        <P><b> MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, which is a software architectural pattern commonly used in web development frameworks like Django. While Django does not strictly adhere to the traditional MVC pattern, it follows a similar architectural design called MTV (Model-Template-View), which is Django's interpretation of MVC.
        </b></p>
        <p>Here's an overview of the components in the Django MTV architecture:</P>
        <ol>
           
            
           <li> Model:</li>
            The model represents the data structure of your application. It defines the database schema and handles the interactions with the database. In Django, models are typically implemented using Python classes that inherit from django.db.models.Model. Each model class represents a database table, and the attributes of the class define the fields and relationships of the table.
            
            <li>Template:</li>
            The template handles the presentation logic and defines how the data is rendered to the user. Templates in Django are written using Django's template language, which allows you to embed dynamic content and control structures. Templates are responsible for generating the HTML or other formats that are sent to the client's web browser.
            
           <li> View:</li>
            The view acts as an intermediary between the models and templates. It contains the business logic of your application and handles the user's requests and responses. Views receive requests from the user's browser, fetch the necessary data from the models, and then render the appropriate template with the data. In Django, views are implemented as Python functions or classes, and they can return various types of responses, such as HTML, JSON, or file downloads.   
        </ol>
<b>ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping. In Django, the ORM is a powerful component that allows developers to interact with the database using Python code instead of writing raw SQL queries.</b>
<p>Here are some key aspects of the Django ORM:</p>
        <ul>
            



<li>Database Abstraction: The ORM abstracts the underlying database, allowing developers to work with different database systems (such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.) without needing to change the code significantly. Django takes care of generating the appropriate SQL statements based on the selected database backend.
</li>
<li>Model Definition: In Django, models are defined as Python classes that inherit from django.db.models.Model. Each attribute in the model class represents a database field. By defining models, developers can create, update, retrieve, and delete records in the database using Python code.
</li>
<li>Database Operations: The Django ORM provides a rich set of methods and APIs for performing common database operations. These include creating and updating records, querying the database for specific data, filtering and sorting results, performing complex joins, and executing custom SQL queries if necessary.
</li>
<li>Querysets: Querysets are Django's way of representing database queries as objects. Querysets allow developers to chain multiple filter conditions, apply ordering, and perform aggregations, all while deferring the actual execution of the query until needed. This lazy evaluation helps optimize performance by only retrieving the necessary data from the database.
</li>
<li>Migrations: The Django ORM includes a built-in migration system. Migrations allow developers to track and manage changes to the database schema over time. Developers can create migrations to add or modify database tables, fields, or relationships. The migration system handles the generation and execution of SQL statements to apply these changes to the database.
</li>
<li>Relationships: The Django ORM supports various types of relationships between models, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships. These relationships are defined using appropriate fields in the model classes, and Django automatically handles the necessary database operations to maintain the integrity of the relationships.
</li>

        </ul>
        <p>Overall, the Django ORM simplifies database interactions by providing an intuitive and Pythonic interface. It eliminates the need for writing low-level SQL queries, making database operations more efficient, readable, and less prone to errors</p>
